Hi, my name is Crista Gregg! 

### Background

I discovered my passion for working with data while working in manufacturing after completing her Chemical Engineering degree, and was drawn into the world of data because of how it can be applied across many types of fields from business to research. After obtaining my Master's in Statistics from NC State University, I had worked with the American Board of Pediatrics using data to answer complex questions about the pediatrician workforce. I love having the ability to take large, complex sets of data and translate it into an elegant visual format that quickly and effectively tells a story and solves a problem.
