title: Thoughts on R and other programming
---

Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites).  
What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  What functionality do you like about R?  What parts do you miss about your other language?  
Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)

I had some experience with R before starting this program from taking Dataquest lessons. I found these lessons very helpful as they gave us short readings followed by short exercises. They also had lessons on Python, and I found the two languages about equal in difficulty. The packages in R are what make the language great. It's wonderful that you can do almost anything you want fairly painlessly with R packages. I haven't spent much time in Python to compare but I would like to spend some more time learning it as I know it is widely used in industry. After having taken the SAS course, I prefer R. U never thought I would be good at coding, but once I discovered that R is essentially a big fancy calculator, it helped me graps the concepts of what I am doing a lot more easily. 

SAS is excellent for performing statistical operations and I feel like the proc steps lead to very clean and intuitive code, but R is definitely more flexible. R also does a lot of the heavy lifitng for you, especially when reading in data and setting attributes, compared to SAS where you have to do it manually. Overall, I prefer SAS for statitical operations such as ANOVA or GLMs, because it gives you a lot of very nicely formatted output, along with interaction plots and such. R, on the other hand, is much  nicer for data manipulation and exploratory data analysis. You have much more felxibiliyt with the dataframes by using the tidyverse, and you can generally get your dta into a usable format in a few lines of code. I also prefer creating charts and graphs in R.
