title: Predictive Models and Automated Reports Project Reflection
---

In this project, I worked with a partner to develop models to predict the number of bicycle rentals given a set of variables. First, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis, creating graphs and summary statistics to understand our data better. Then, we fit four separate models on a training set using cross-validation. We then tested those models on a test set and compared the MSE for each fit. We set up the markdown code to create a different report for each day of the week when knit.

The most difficult part of this project was automating the report to create the reports for each day of the week, but it was not too bad. If I were to do this project differently, I would incorporate a selection process during the cross-validation for the variables to be included in the model.

The big take-away from this project is that it is much more efficient collaborating in Github for a team project. In the past, I have attempted to email the files back and forth, which was time-consuming and frustrating. Using Github made the workflow much easier and helped me understand why it is so prevalant in data science and programming.
